# kstd ( Kernel Standard Template Library )

For obvious reasons the normal C++ `STL` libraries are not usable in `kernel Mode` 
and since sometime doing all the string / list allocations manually 
in `kernel mode` can be tedious i decided to implement some basic `STL` functionalities in order
to simplify the process.

### Classes:
- [x] string
- [x] wstring
- [x] vector

A big thanks to my friend [`FURYWOLF`](https://github.com/xxFURYWOLFxx) for the collaboration.
